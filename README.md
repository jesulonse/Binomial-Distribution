# Binomial-Distribution
There are three means to find the probability of a coin. The no of coin flips will determine the formular to use.
a. Coin flips(for single coin flips)
b. Binomial Distributions(for about 100 coin flips)
c. Normal Distributions(for 10000 to inifinity coin flips)
This code is designed to find the maximum no. of heads in which the flips of a coin will yield the maximum binomial distribution value
